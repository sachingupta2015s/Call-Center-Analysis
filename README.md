# Call-Center-Analysis
In this Call center Dashboard, I have used all the processes of Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, and Pre-processing and after which I got an overview about what are pros and cons of the Call Center industry with the help of Excel. My Role was involved in Six processes: • Understanding the Business Insights, • Describing the dataset, • Preparing the data, • Performing Exploratory Analysis, • Visualize and present your findings.
