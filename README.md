# Call-Center-Analysis
In this Call center Dashboard, I have used all the processes of Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, and Pre-processing and after which I got an overview about what are pros and cons of the Call Center industry with the help of Excel. My Role was involved in Six processes: • Understanding the Business Insights, • Describing the dataset, • Preparing the data, • Performing Exploratory Analysis, • Visualize and present your findings.
Let me share with you how the dashboard looks:

Step 1: Download the dataset and open the file.
I already provided the link to the dataset above, you can also google ‘Real World Fake Data call-centers’ and you should be able to find it. once it’s downloaded open the file and let’s take a look:

well well well, what do we have here? we have 10 columns and 5000 records(rows). The columns are pretty self explanatory. I guess, that’s it for this step.

Step 2: Observe the data and make sure all is good.
This step is crucial. Just look around and press different things and make sure your data is good to go. Since I already used this dataset once I pretty much know it but we still need to get some things outta the way. Because I learned the hard way to check data types before proceeding lol. First off, check out the call_timestamp column. You may notice some of them are aligned to the left and some to the right. Click on the column itself and then left align all of them(or to the right, I prefer left).


Step 3: Pivot Tables and build Charts.

In this step we will build our charts and Pivot tables that we will later use in our dashboard. Out of convenience, each of the charts I will create in a separate tab to keep things tidy. We will create various charts which are:

Step 4: Building our Dashboard !
It saddens me to say but this step needs a visual tutorial, no way in the five hells that I can accomplish it using writing and screenshots. 

Now goodbye Thank u...
